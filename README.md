Project: Forklift Dispatch Simulator

- Built a visual map interface in React Native to simulate forklift movements and order dispatching in real time.

- Developed a list interface to track forklifts, orders, and statuses with live updates.

- Implemented features to modify forklift behaviors, block/unblock forklifts, and test use cases.

- Designed and integrated the backend with FastAPI for smooth data flow and real-time synchronization.

- Structured and optimized the PostgreSQL database for efficient forklift and order management.

- Collaborated with teammates and mentors to improve usability and scalability.

Outcome: Delivered a tool that helps clients optimize logistics operations, improve decision-making, and reduce warehouse costs through intuitive simulation and insights.
